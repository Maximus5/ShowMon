## About
This small tool helps with testing multimonitor-aware applicataions
in the ‘single-monitor’ environment.

Of course, ‘monitor’ must be installed in your system, but if this
secondary monitor is not accessible, turned of or distant from your working place,
it is very hard to use it.

This tool helps. It creates small top-most window on the first monitor where
continuously shows the contents of secondary monitor scaled-down.

But when your mouse cursor is on secondary monitor you will see small
part of it with 100% zoom.
